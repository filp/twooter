# twooter

A super simple example application with AngularJS, mimicking
twitter's basic functionality. The purpose of this application
is to act as a basic demo of some of Angular's functionality,
and not as an example of good development practices, user interface
design or breakdancing expertise.

Note that this example does not include tests - something you
**do want** to have in any real application, keep that in mind.

If you're looking for a more fleshed out example, have a look at
the [AngularJS TodoMVC example](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/angularjs/)


If you do have any question(s), let me know through twitter - [@imfilp](http://twitter.com/imfilp).

Enjoy!
